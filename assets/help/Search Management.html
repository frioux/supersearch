   <h2>Search Management</h2>

   Search data is stored as three basic parts:
   <dl>
      <dt>Name</dt><dd>The name that will be displayed in the spinner for the search.</dd>
      <dt>URL</dt><dd>The URL that the search is based on; put %s in the URL to have the search insert whatever term you want in the URL.</dd>
      <dt>Term</dt><dd>This is what you are actually doing when you search; for example you search on Google, but you Define on Merriam-Webster.</dd>
   </dl>
